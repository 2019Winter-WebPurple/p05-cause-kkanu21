            <h2>Handling Refugees in the US</h2> <!-- first paragraph about immigration in the US -->
            <p>Dating back to early years, refugees were welcomed into the United States under the International Humanitarian Law. Since 1980, the refugee program began to fluctuate.

Instead, President Donald Trump recently lowered the number of refugee acceptance in the United States. To ensure the safety of millions, there will need to be change.</p>
